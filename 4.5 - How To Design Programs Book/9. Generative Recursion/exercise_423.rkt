; Exercise 423.
; Define partition.
; It consumes a String s and a natural number n.
; The function produces a list of string chunks of size n.

; For non-empty strings s and positive natural numbers n,
; (equal? (partition s n) (bundle (explode s) n)) is #true. But donâ€™t use this equality as the definition for partition; use substring instead.

; Hint Have partition produce its natural result for the empty string. For the case where n is 0, see exercise 421.

; Note The partition function is somewhat closer to what a cooperative DrRacket environment would need than bundle.
