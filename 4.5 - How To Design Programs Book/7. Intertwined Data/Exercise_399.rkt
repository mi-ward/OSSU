; Exercise 399.
; Louise, Jane, Laura, Dana, and Mary decide to run a lottery that assigns one gift recipient to each of them.
; Since Jane is a developer, they ask her to write a program that performs this task in an impartial manner.
; Of course, the program must not assign any of the sisters to herself.
