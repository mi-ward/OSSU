;Exercise 313.
;Suppose we need the function blue-eyed-ancestor?,
;which is like blue-eyed-child? but responds with #true
;only when a proper ancestor, not the given child itself, has blue eyes.

;==================================================

;Although the goals clearly differ, the signatures are the same:
;FT -> Boolean
;Respond with true if (child-father) or (child-mother) has blue-eyes
(define (blue-eyed-ancestor? an-ftree)
  (local [(define (blue-eyes? ft)
            (and (child? ft) (string=? (child-eyes ft) "blue")))] 
  (cond
    [(no-parent? an-ftree) #false]
    [else (or (blue-eyes? (child-father an-ftree))
              (blue-eyes? (child-mother an-ftree))
              (blue-eyed-ancestor? (child-father an-ftree))
              (blue-eyed-ancestor? (child-mother an-ftree)))])))
             

(check-expect (blue-eyed-child? Eva) #true)
(check-expect (blue-eyed-ancestor? Eva) #false)
(check-expect (blue-eyed-ancestor? Gustav) #true)


;Now suppose a friend comes up with this solution:
;(define (blue-eyed-ancestor? an-ftree)
;  (cond
;    [(no-parent? an-ftree) #false]
;    [else
;     (or
;      (blue-eyed-ancestor?
;       (child-father an-ftree))
;      (blue-eyed-ancestor?
;       (child-mother an-ftree)))]))


;Explain why this function fails one of its tests.
; - beacause it results in #false
;What is the result of (blue-eyed-ancestor? A)
;no matter which A you choose? Can you fix your friendâ€™s solution?

;it results in false no matter what
;yes, leverage a local function to check for ancestors eyes
