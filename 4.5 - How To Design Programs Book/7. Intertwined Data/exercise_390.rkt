; Exercise 390
; Design the function tree-pick.
; The function consumes a tree of symbols and a list of directions

(define-struct branch [left right])

; A TOS is one of:
; - Symbol
; - (make-branch TOS TOS)

; A Direction is one of:
; - 'left
; - 'right

; A list of Directions is also called a path.

; Clearly a Direction tells the function whether to choose the
; left or the right branch in a nonsymbolic tree.

; What is the result of the tree-pick function? A symbol

; Donâ€™t forget to formulate a full signature.
; The function signals an error when given a symbol and a non-empty path.


; TOS [List-of Directions] -> Symbol
; Navigates through the list of directions to find a symbol
