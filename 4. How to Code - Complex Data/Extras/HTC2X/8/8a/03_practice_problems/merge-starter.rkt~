; Problem:
;
; Design the function merge. It consumes two lists of numbers, which it assumes are
; each sorted in ascending order. It produces a single list of all the numbers,
; also sorted in ascending order.
;
; Your solution should explicitly show the cross product of type comments table,
; filled in with the values in each case. Your final function should have a cond
; with 3 cases. You can do this simplification using the cross product table by
; recognizing that there are subtly equal answers.
;
; Hint: Think carefully about the values of both lists. You might see a way to
; change a cell content so that 2 cells have the same value.
