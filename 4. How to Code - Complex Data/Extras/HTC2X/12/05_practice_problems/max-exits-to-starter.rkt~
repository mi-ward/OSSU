; PROBLEM:
;
; Using the following data definition, design a function that produces the room to which the greatest
; number of other rooms have exits (in the case of a tie you can produce any of the rooms in the tie).
;


;; Data Definitions:

(define-struct room (name exits))
;; Room is (make-room String (listof Room))
;; interp. the room's name, and list of rooms that the exits lead to

; .

(define H1 (make-room "A" (list (make-room "B" empty))))

; .

(define H2
  (shared ((-0- (make-room "A" (list (make-room "B" (list -0-))))))
    -0-))


; .

(define H3
  (shared ((-A- (make-room "A" (list -B-)))
           (-B- (make-room "B" (list -C-)))
           (-C- (make-room "C" (list -A-))))
    -A-))



; .

(define H4
  (shared ((-A- (make-room "A" (list -B- -D-)))
           (-B- (make-room "B" (list -C- -E-)))
