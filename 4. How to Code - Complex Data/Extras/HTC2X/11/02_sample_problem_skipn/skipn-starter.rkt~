; PROBLEM:
;
; Design a function that consumes a list of elements lox and a natural number
; n and produces the list formed by including the first element of lox, then
; skipping the next n elements, including an element, skipping the next n
; and so on.
;
;  (skipn (list "a" "b" "c" "d" "e" "f") 2) should produce (list "a" "d")
;
