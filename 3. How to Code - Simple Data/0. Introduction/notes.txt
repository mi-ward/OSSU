Systematic Program Design
1. What do we want our program to do?
2. How we create nice programs that fit together well and are easy to modify?

Each Module is a series of extended lectures
- really just you and I sitting at computer to work through design process
- Best thing to do is type along, run the problem with the teacher

At the end of each module is a set of practice problems and a quiz

Techniques will be used with any other programming language in the future.

This course uses BSL (Beginner Student Language)
- easy to learn
- easy to apply to design method
- has all the core features we'll need
