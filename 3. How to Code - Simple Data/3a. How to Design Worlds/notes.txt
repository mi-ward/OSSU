Learning Goals
 - Be able to explain the inherent structure of interactive graphical programs.
 - Be able to use the How to Design Worlds (HtDW) recipe to design interactive programs with atomic world state.
 - Be able to read and write big-bang expressions.

 HtDW recipe
 
 1. Domain analysis (use a piece of paper)
    1. Sketch program scenarios (story board on a piece of paper)
        - 2 or 3 images reflecting the different states of the program
       
          <----width--->
      ^   ______________    ______________   ______________

      v

    2. Identify constant information (label on scenario sketches)
        width 
        height
        ctr-y: cat's y coordinate doesn't change
        mts: (empty scene) background images
        cat image

    3. Identify changing information
        cat x: cat's coordinate

    4. Identify big-bang options
        on-tick
        to-draw
