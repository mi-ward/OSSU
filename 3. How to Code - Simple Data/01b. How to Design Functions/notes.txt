Learning Goals
1. Be able to use the How to Design Functions (HtDF) recipe to design functions that operate on primitive data.
2. Be able to read a complete function design and identify its different elements.
3. Be able to evaluate the different elements for clarity, simplicity and consistency with each other.
4 Be able to evaluate the entire design for how well it solves the given problem.

HtDF (How to Define Functions) CHECKLIST
1. Signature, purpose, stub
2. Define examples, wrap each in check-expect
3. Template and inventory
4. Code the function body
5. Test and debug until correct

Signature 
Shows us what comes in and what goes out of a function

Function - 
should be short 1 line, succint description of what the function outputs given what it consumes

Stub
Function definition with
- correct function name
- correct number of parameters
- produce dummy result of correct type

Examples - serve as unit tests, build off signature, function, and stub
Inventory - a template for the function
code body - just elaborate the examples and finish the function
run the tests - run the tests
