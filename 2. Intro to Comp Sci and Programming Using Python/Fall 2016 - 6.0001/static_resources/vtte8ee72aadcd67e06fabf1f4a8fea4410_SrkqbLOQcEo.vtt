00:00:24.037 --> 00:00:25.370
ANA BELL: Let's walk through it.

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:30.780
We have three lists.

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:33.220
L1 is equal to [re].

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.630
L2 is equal to [mi].

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.570
L3 is equal to [do].

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:46.120
L4 is equal to-- let's just do
what it says here-- L1 plus L2.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.421
So it's going to be the list
[re, mi]-- uh, yeah, mi.

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.250
Now, extend() is going
to mutate the list.

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:03.040
So that means L3 is going to
be extended by whatever L4 is.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.704
So L3 is going to be-- OK,
what did it have originally?

00:01:05.704 --> 00:01:08.292
It had do.

00:01:08.292 --> 00:01:09.750
And then, it's
going to be extended

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:16.050
by all of the elements inside
L4, which is re, mi, like that.

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:20.030
And once I've mutated
it, the old version of L3

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:21.210
is gone, right?

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.350
This is the L3 down here
that I'm going to work with.

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.380
L3.sort() is going to
sort alphabetically.

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.310
So that's [do, mi, re].

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:35.640
Yep.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.740
And sort() also
mutates the list.

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.690
So the old version of
the list I have is gone.

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.250
del is going to also
mutate the list.

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.440
So it's going to look
in L3, look at index 0,

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.620
and it's going to
delete that-- it's

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.380
going to delete that element.

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.240
So it's going to mutate L3.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.140
And it's going to
be [mi, re], OK?

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:04.760
And once again, I've
mutated the list.

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.000
So the old version's gone.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.500
And lastly-- this is a tricky
part-- I'm going to append,

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:20.350
to my current L3, which looks
like this, another list.

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.050
So to L3, I'm
appending another list.

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:29.758
So this is going to be
the list [fa, la], OK?

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.380
So [mi, re], and then the
list [fa, la] is the answer,

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:42.445
which is red-- no, sorry, blue.

00:02:42.445 --> 00:02:44.160
Good, you had me scared.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.120
OK.

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.334
Perfect.

00:02:48.334 --> 00:02:49.750
So if you didn't
get this, I would

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.063
suggest you go through
the Python tutor

00:02:53.063 --> 00:02:55.354
or you just trace it out by
hand, just like I just did.

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.850
And hopefully it'll
be apparent, the more

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.960
exercises you do with lists,
what exactly is going on.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.510
OK.
