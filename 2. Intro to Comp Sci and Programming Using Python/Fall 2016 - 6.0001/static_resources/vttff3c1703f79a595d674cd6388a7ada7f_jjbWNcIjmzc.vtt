ANA BELL: So we have x is
going to be whatever number

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:30.260
the user types in, y is
going to be whatever number

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:31.280
the user types in.

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.540
First thing I'm going to
check is if x is equal to y.

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:43.400
So if we type in x is 0 and
y is 5, 0 is not equal to 5,

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.100
so we're not even
going to consider

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.410
what's in this code block.

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:49.885
Then we're going to check
the next one-- if 0 is

00:00:49.885 --> 00:00:52.480
less than 5-- and that's true.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.730
So this is the very
first conditional

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:56.650
that evaluates to
true, so we're just

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:58.140
going to print x is smaller.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.160
And I think that's what's
being dragged down here.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.010
Awesome.
