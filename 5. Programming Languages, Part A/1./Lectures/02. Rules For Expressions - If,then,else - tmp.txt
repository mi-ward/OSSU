Syntax:
  if e1 then e2 else e3
  where if, then, and else are keywords and
  e1, e2, and e3 are subexpressions

Type-checking:
  first e1 must have type bool
  e2 and e3 can have any type (let's call it t), but they
  must have the same type t
  the type of the entire expression is also t

Evaluation rules:
  first evaluate e1 to value v1 call it v1
  if it's true, evaluate e2 and the result is the whole expression's result
  else, evaluate e3 and that result is the whole expression's result
